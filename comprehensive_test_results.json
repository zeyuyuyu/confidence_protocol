What are common mistakes people make on this type of problem? A common mistake is assuming that the ball must cost a small amount without correctly considering the relationship between the bat and the ball's prices.\n\n[Step-by-step verification]: \n1. Let the cost of the ball be \\( x \\).\n2. Then the cost of the bat would be \\( x + 1.00 \\).\n3. According to the problem, the total cost is given by:\n   \\[\n   x + (x + 1.00) = 1.10\n   \\]\n4. Simplifying this, we get:\n   \\[\n   2x + 1.00 = 1.10\n   \\]\n5. Subtracting 1.00 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   2x = 0.10\n   \\]\n6. Dividing by 2:\n   \\[\n   x = 0.05\n   \\]\n7. Therefore, the ball costs $0.05, and the bat costs $1.05, which totals $1.10.\n\n[Final Answer]: The ball costs $0.05.\n\n[Confidence]: 95%",

According to the problem, the bat costs $1.00 more than the ball, so the cost of the bat can be expressed as \\( x + 1.00 \\).\n\nThe total cost of the bat and ball is given as $1.10. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[\nx + (x + 1.00) = 1.10\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this equation:\n\n\\[\n2x + 1.00 = 1.10\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract $1.00 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n2x = 1.10 - 1.00\n\\]\n\\[\n2x = 0.10\n\\]\n\nNow, we divide both sides by 2 to find \\( x \\):\n\n\\[\nx = 0.10 / 2\n\\]\n\\[\nx = 0.05\n\\]\n\nThus, the cost of the ball is \\( \\text{0.05} \\) or 5 cents. \n\nTo confirm, if the ball costs 5 cents, then the bat, being $1.00 more, costs \\( 0.05 + 1.00 = 1.05 \\).

Common mistakes include miscalculating the voting dynamics or the next round of proposals. Pirates might think too selfishly or not consider what the remaining pirates would do if they were to propose next.\n\n[Step-by-step verification]: \n1. If A is thrown overboard, B proposes next. B knows that if they are thrown overboard, C will get all the gold (100 coins). So B would propose to take 99 coins for themselves and give C 1 coin. This would guarantee C's support since C would prefer 1 coin over none.\n2. Therefore, A needs to secure at least one vote to survive. A has the option to propose something that B would prefer over the next proposal from B.\n3. A could propose to give C 1 coin (to secure C's vote) and keep 99 coins themselves. However, B would reject this proposal because they would get nothing in the next round.\n4. A needs to offer B more than they would receive if A is thrown overboard. If A proposes to give B 2 coins (which is more than what they would get if A is thrown overboard) and gives C 0 coins, B would accept this (B will receive 2 coins instead of 0).\n5.

        "first_answer": "To determine what Pirate A should propose to divide the 100 gold coins, we need to analyze the situation step by step, considering the preferences of the pirates and the voting process.\n\n1. **Understanding the Voting Dynamics**:\n   - Each pirate wants to stay alive first, then maximize their gold, and finally prefer to see others thrown overboard if it doesn't affect their own situation.\n   - A proposal needs 50% of the votes to pass. In this case, with three pirates (A, B, C), a proposal will pass if at least two out of the three vote in favor.\n\n2. **Backwards Induction**:\n   - Let’s consider what would happen if only two pirates remain:\n     - If it comes down to B and C, B knows that if he is thrown overboard, C will get all 100 coins. So, B would propose to take 100 coins for himself, and C would get 0. B would vote in favor of his own proposal. C would have no choice but to accept it, as he would get nothing otherwise. Thus, B would get 100, C would get 0.\n\n3. **Next Step**:\n   - Now consider the scenario with 3 pirates (A, B, C):\n     - If A is thrown overboard, the outcome would be the situation above where B gets 100 coins and C gets 0.\n     - Therefore, B would be happy to accept any proposal from A that gives him more than 0 coins.\n\n4. **Optimal Proposal by A**:\n   - Knowing that B will get 100 coins if A is thrown overboard, A should propose something that gives B a better deal than getting nothing (which he would get if A is thrown overboard).\n   - A can propose to give C 1 coin and keep 99 coins for himself. Here’s the breakdown:\n     - A gets 99 coins, B gets 0 coins, C gets 1 coin.\n     - C would vote for this proposal because if A is thrown overboard, C will then face the proposal from B, which would leave C with nothing.\n     - A's proposal would pass with A and C’s votes (2 votes in favor).\n\n5. **Final Proposal**:\n   - Therefore, Pirate A should propose: \n     - A: 99 coins\n     - B: 0 coins\n     - C: 1 coin\n   - This proposal gives C more than he would get if A were tossed overboard, and it guarantees A's survival and maximizes his own gold.\n\nThus, Pirate A's optimal proposal is to keep 99 coins for himself, give 0 coins to Pirate B, and give 1 coin to Pirate C.",
        "final_answer": "Let's analyze the problem step by step carefully to ensure we understand the dynamics and come to the correct conclusion.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Voting Dynamics\n\n- There are three pirates: A, B, and C.\n- A proposal needs at least 50% of the votes to pass. In this case, that means at least 2 out of 3 votes are needed.\n- The pirates prefer (1) staying alive, (2) getting more gold, and (3) seeing others thrown overboard.\n\n### Step 2: Backward Induction\n\nLet's analyze what happens in the scenarios with fewer pirates first, which will affect the decisions of the pirates when all three are present.\n\n#### Scenario with 2 Pirates (B and C):\n\n- If A is thrown overboard, B and C will vote. B knows that if he is thrown overboard, C will take all 100 coins. Thus, B will propose:\n  - B: 100 coins\n  - C: 0 coins\n- B will vote for this and C will have no choice but to accept it since he would get nothing if B is in charge.\n\n#### Scenario with 3 Pirates (A, B, and C):\n\nNow, we need to analyze what A should propose when all three pirates are present.\n\n1. **If A is thrown overboard**: \n   - **B and C** will remain, and B will propose 100 coins for himself and 0 for C (as established above).\n  \n2. **A's Proposal**: \n   - A needs to get at least one vote in addition to his own to secure the proposal.\n   - He should consider what he can offer to either B or C to ensure he gets their vote.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing offers\n\n- **If A offers C**:\n  - A knows that C gets 0 if A is thrown overboard (because B will take all).\n  - A can offer C 1 coin. Thus, A proposes:\n    - A: 99 coins\n    - B: 0 coins\n    - C: 1 coin\n  - In this case, C will vote for A's proposal because 1 coin is better than 0.\n\n- **If A offers B**:\n  - A could also offer B something, but it’s important to note that if A offers B any amount greater than 0, C will still vote against because he would get nothing if A were thrown overboard. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo maximize his gold and ensure at least one vote from C, A should propose:\n\n- A: 98 coins\n- B: 0 coins\n- C: 2 coins\n\nIn this scenario:\n- A votes for his own proposal (1 vote).\n- C votes for A's proposal because 2 coins are better than the 0 he would get if A were thrown overboard (2nd vote).\n- B would vote against, but it doesn't matter because A has secured the necessary votes.\n\nThus, the best proposal for Pirate A is:\n\n**A: 98 coins, B: 0 coins, C: 2 coins.**\n\nThis proposal ensures A keeps the most coins while securing the votes needed to pass.
